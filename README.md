Time-Series Forecasting of MSFT Stock Prices using LSTM

Overview

This project uses an LSTM neural network to predict Microsoft (MSFT) stock prices based on historical data (2013-2018). Built with TensorFlow/Keras, it preprocesses data, trains an LSTM model, and visualizes actual vs. predicted closing prices.
